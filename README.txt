Real Guns Hardcode

Building release version:
Just execute the build-release.bat file. The WAD file will be in the output folder once the console window closes.

Debugging:
Since the build-release.bat takes a lot of time to execute, there is also a build-debug.bat file. To use this, you have to put your skulltag directory to the system PATH variable (google how to do this). Then you can execute the build-debug.bat and Skulltag with loaded debug version of RGH will open within moments.
